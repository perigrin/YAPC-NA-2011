<h2>WHY SPONSOR YAPC::NA?</h2>

<p>Perl is an Open Source and Open Community programming language, and
among the top ten in the world*. All improvements to the language are
done on a personal time donation basis or by community grants. YAPC (Yet
Another Perl Conference) is the only annual Perl specific conference.
This year YAPC NA (North America) will be held at the Crowne Plaza
Asheville, June 27st – 29th, 2010.</p>

<p>YAPC::NA has been a regularly attended annual conference since 1999,
with delegates and speakers from around North America, UK, Europe and
the world. Although the primary subject for tutorials and presentations
is the Perl programming language, many Open Source projects, such as
Parrot, Apache, MySQL and Linux, have been covered as well.</p>

<p>When a company sponsors YAPC they are really supporting the Perl
language and the Perl community. The stronger the community becomes the
more robust and the better the language becomes.</p>

<p>The YAPC conference is run on minimal cost basis ($33.00 per attendee
per day) so that a couple of objectives can be met:</p>

<ol>
<li> Education of the masses. The cheaper the registration fees the more people that can attend. The larger the attendance the more the community grows. 
<li> Perl is a fun language. If attendees have a fun and educational experience
the more they want to use the language and the bigger the community grows. 
<li> YAPC gives back. The initial goal of the YAPC conference is to cover all of
its costs; once all costs are resolved the remaining funds are given back to
the community through grants. 
<li> YAPC helps companies promote their business. As a sponsor of YAPC you
get exposure to all of top talent of the Perl community. The exposure helps to recruit talent to better your company and your bottom line.
</ol>

<p>Every donation makes a difference to the community. Sponsorship
starts as little as $200.00 at the bronze level and goes all the way up
to helping carry the conference for $10,000 at the platinum level.</p>

<p>Please take a moment and consider what your company can do to help
the Perl Community through a donation to the YAPC conference. For more
information please contact us at EMAIL_ADDRESS.</p>

<h3>Brand and Product Awareness</h3>

<p>The conference is attended by IT professionals - the majority of whom
are from around North America, UK and Europe, with a small number from
further overseas. Most of the attendees are Developers, System
Administrators and Technical Architects, although there is also a
significant proportion of CIO’s and CEOs. The impact of the conference
can be felt far wider than the number of attendees – many open source
websites, will feature references to YAPC::NA and attract high traffic,
which will provide exposure for key sponsors.</p>

<h3>Recruitment Opportunity</h3>

<p>Historically YAPC::NA has attracted some of North America’s leading
Perl talent, and the format of this conference will provide sponsors
with a fantastic opportunity to have representatives on site to meet and
discuss issues and opportunities with delegates.</p>

<h3>Promote your Open Source Credentials</h3>

<p>What better way to promote your organization’s commitment to leverage
the benefits of Open Source technologies, than to sponsor an event such
as the North American Perl Conference? By demonstrating a symbiotic
relationship with the grass roots of a large Open Source movement such
as the North American Perl Community, you can demonstrate a level of
understanding and commitment to Open Source that will distinguish
yourself from your competitors.</p>
